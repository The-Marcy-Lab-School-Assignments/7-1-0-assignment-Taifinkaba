First, import the context.

Third, use the info from context.

Import `createContext`
implement a empty object 
wrap  component tree with `MyContext.Provider` and pass the value you  want.
import `useContext` and the context you made
use `useContext`  to access the data.

Your steps focus more on using an existing context rather than incorporating it from the start. Remember, to properly integrate context into your application, you first need to create the context, then provide it using a context provider, and finally access it with useContext.
